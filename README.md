NFECT
=====

NFECT (Node.js Front-End Construction Tool) is a Node.js module that uses a JavaScript object called a "descriptor" to specify loading, execution, and code-inclusion details for external file and source code dependencies. The vision is to provide a mechanism for front-end developers to easily incorporate many dependencies (such as common header and footer HTML files, CSS files, and client-side JavaScript files) without needing to learn and use special content markup or awkward design patterns. NFECT also allows a developer to safely pass data via the descriptor object to and between each of these dependencies.
